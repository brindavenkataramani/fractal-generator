# Fractal Generator

Contains a fractal generator as well as some tools to analyze fractal dimension. This was originally written for the final project of Physics 2G03 at McMaster University in Fall 2017.

## Generating and plotting fractals

Compile and run fractals.c, and then run scatter.py to plot the generated fractal. Feel free to tweak some constants to generate a variety of structures. Feel free to modify the axes/colors.

## Analyzing fractals

You can analyze fractal dimension using bestfit.py. Randomize either r or stickiness and run the program some number of times to see how fractal dimension varies with stickiness or r.
