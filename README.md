# Fractal Generator

Contains a fractal generator as well as some tools to analyze fractal dimension. See the .pdf for more usage tips, as well as an analysis by me. This was originally written for the final project of Physics 2G03 at McMaster University in Fall 2017.

## Generating and plotting fractals

Compile and run fractals.c, and then run scatter.py to plot the generated fractal. Feel free to tweak some constants to generate a variety of structures.
